## My process

- Think and built the design with HTML and CSS.
- Manipulate all the div's and id's with Javascript that we will need to acess.
- Add event listeners to those button where we want to maiupulate.
- Then add the function after adding the eventlisteners which helps to perform the desired operation through implementing the logic inside the function.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Javascript
